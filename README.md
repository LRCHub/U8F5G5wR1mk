[02:24.08] Ain't no other king in this rap thing like siblings
[02:26.36] Nothing but my children, one shot, they disappearin'
[02:28.90] I'm in a city with a flag, be getting thrown like it was past
[02:31.57] Interference padlock around the building
[02:33.25] Crash, pulling up in a marked truck just to play freeze tag
[02:35.68] With a bone to pick, like it was sea bass
[02:37.74] So when I made it out I made about 50K from a show
[02:40.22] Trying to show niggas the ropes before they hung from a rope
[03:10.22] 
[02:42.63] I'm prophetic, they only talk about it, how I get it
[02:45.58] Only good for saving face, seen the cosmetics
[02:47.77] How many heads I gotta take to level my aesthetics?
[02:50.14] Hurry up and get your muscle up, we out to plyometric
[02:52.46] Nicarana by the lux, soon as I up the highest metric
[02:54.95] The city just made it sweet, you could die, bet it
[02:57.34] They mouth get full of deceit, let these cowards tell it
[02:59.40] Walk in New Orleans with the etiquette of L.A. yelling
[03:26.40] 
[03:01.96] Mustard (oh, man)
[03:06.61] Niggas actin' bad, but somebody gotta do it
