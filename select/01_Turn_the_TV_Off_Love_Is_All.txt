I'm wasting my life just watching the TV
No matter what they say I just can't agree
I'm wasting my life just watching the TV
No matter what they say I just can't agree

I've gotta myself together
There has to be something that is better
I've gotta myself together
There has to be something that is better

I'm wasting my life just watching the TV
No matter what they say I just can't agree
I'm wasting my life just watching the TV
No matter what they say I just can't agree

I've gotta myself together
There has to be something that is better
I've gotta myself together
There has to be something that is better than this

(Repeat)
