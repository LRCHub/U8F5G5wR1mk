All I ever wanted was a
Black Grand National
Fuck being rational,
give 'em what they ask for
It's not enough (Ayy)
Few solid niggas left,
but it's not enough
Few bitches that'll really
step, but it's not enough
Say you bigger than myself,
but it's not enough (Huh)
I get on they ass, yeah,
somebody gotta do it
I'll make them niggas mad,
yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll take the G-pass,
shit, watch a nigga do it
Huh, we survived outside,
all from the music, nigga, what?
They like, "What he on?"
It's the Alpha and Omega,
bitch, welcome home
This is not a song
This a revеlation, how to
get a nigga gone
You need you a man, baby,
I don't understand, baby
Pay your bill and makе
you feel protected like
I can, baby
Teach you somethin' if
you need correction,
that's the plan, baby
Don't put your life in
these weird niggas'
hands, baby (Woah)
It's not enough (Ayy)
Few solid niggas left,
but it's not enough
Few bitches that'll really
step, but it's not enough
Say you bigger than myself,
but it's not enough (Huh)
I get on they ass, yeah,
somebody gotta do it
I'll make them niggas mad,
yeah, somebody gotta do it
I'll take the G-pass, shit,
watch a nigga do it
Huh, we survived outside,
all from the music, nigga, what?
Hey, turn this TV off
Ain't with my type
activities? Then don't
you get involved
Hey, what, huh, how many
should I send? Send 'em all
Take a risk or take a trip,
you know I'm trippin' for my dog
Who you with? Couple
sergeants and lieutenants
for the get back
This revolution been
televised, I fell through
with the knick-knacks
Hey, young nigga, get your
chili up, yeah, I meant that
Hey, black out if they
act out, yeah, I did that
Hey, what's up, though?
I hate a bitch that's hatin'
on a bitch and they both hoes
I hate a nigga hatin' on
them niggas and they both broke
If you ain't coming for no
chili, what you come for?
Nigga feel like he entitled
'cause he knew me since a kid
Bitch, I cut my granny off
if she don't see it how I
see it, hm
Got a big mouth but he lack
big ideas
Send him to the moon, that's
just how I feel, yellin'
It's not enough (Ayy)
Few solid niggas left,
but it's not enough
Few bitches that'll really
step, but it's not enough
Say you bigger than myself,
but it's not enough
Huh
Huh, huh
Hey
Hey (Mustard on the beat, ho)
Mustard
Niggas actin' bad, but
somebody gotta do it
Got my foot up on the gas,
but somebody gotta do it
Huh, turn this TV off,
turn this TV off
Huh, turn this TV off,
turn this TV off
Huh, turn this TV off,
turn this TV off
Huh, turn this TV off,
turn this TV off
Ain't no other king in
this rap thing, like siblings
Nothing but my children,
one shot, they disappearin'
I'm in a city with a flag,
be gettin' thrown like it
was pass interference
Padlock around the building
Crash, pullin' up in
unmarked truck just to
play freeze tag
With a bone to pick like
it was sea bass
So when I made it out,
I made about fifty K from a show
Tryna show niggas the
ropes before they hung
from a rope
I'm prophetic, they only
talk about it how I get it
Only good for saving face,
seen the cosmetics
How many heads I gotta
take to level my aesthetics?
Hurry up and get your muscle
up, we out the plyometric
Nicarana by the lux, soon
as I up the highest metric
The city just made it sweet,
you could die, I bet it
They mouth get full of
deceit, let these cowards
tell it
Walk in New Orleans with
the etiquette of L.A., yellin'
Mustard (Ah, man)
Niggas actin' bad, but
somebody gotta do it
Got my foot up on the gas,
but somebody gotta do it
Huh, turn this TV off,
turn this TV off
Huh, turn this TV off,
turn this TV off
Huh, turn this TV off,
turn this TV off
Huh, turn this TV off,
turn this TV off
Shit gets crazy, scary,
spooky, hilarious
Crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious
Shit gets crazy, scary,

Crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious
Shit gets crazy, scary,
spooky, hilarious
Crazy, scary, spooky, hilarious
Shit gets crazy, scary,
spooky, hilarious
Crazy, scary, spooky,
